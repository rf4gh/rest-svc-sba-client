## the only role of this sample program is to act as a Spring Boot Admin server client
## (instead of the full rest-svc-db-client which needs a database server)

The Maven POM is equipped with the Fabric8 plugin for deploying into Kubernetes with no (minimal) manual maintenance of K8s descriptor files.
These are generated by Fabric8 plugin.
We have the following Fabric8 maven plugin configurations via resource fragment files:
* /src/main/fabric8/__deployment.yml__ dynamically sets environment variables and defines the liveness/readiness probe URIs from the K8s default of /health to /actuator/health/ . Any changes must be reflected in __SecurityConfig.java__ as well! The port number is somehow redundantly specified.
* /src/main/fabric8/__service.yml__ changes the type of the K8s service created from ClusterIP to NodePort (for easier access in the single-node minikube environment)
